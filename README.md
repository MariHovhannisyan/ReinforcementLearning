This repository showcases various projects developed as part of the Reinforcement Learning (RL) course at NPUA. The primary objective of these projects is to implement and experiment with RL algorithms to tackle diverse challenges, ranging from training intelligent agents to optimizing decision-making strategies in simulated scenarios. The methodologies and implementations are inspired by various research works and academic resources, which are further detailed in the [source]( https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf).
